exoMMR is a package designed to find, confirm, and characterize mean motion resonances in exoplanetary systems.

FEATURES:
Find: calculates two bodies' proximity to resonance; returns coefficients of two- and three-body resonant angles based on orbital periods 
Confirm: runs suites of N-body (rebound) simulations; analyzes resonant angles from each simulation and returns center and amplitude; calculates 
what percentage of simulations have which angle librating
Characterize: summarizes the centers and amplitudes of any librating angles; characterizes resonant chains by how many simulations have each planet 
dynamically decoupled; constrains parameters (e.g., mass, eccentricity) based on resonant angle libration; includes various helpful plotting functions

QUICK INSTALLATION:
pip install exoMMR 
or
python -m pip install exoMMR

TODO
- Get user-defined units working
- Include periodogram analysis
- Include separatrix analysis
- Implement chain formation exploration
- Implement neural net
- Include SS expansions

PAPERS:
- MacDonald, Feil, Quinn, and Rice 2022 (The Astronomical Journal, Volume 163, Issue 4, id.162, 12 pp.) develops the framework for exoMMR and 
demonstrates the ability to constrain resonances with N-body simulations

- MacDonald and Quinn 2023 (submitted to The Astronomical Journal) tests exoMMR on five additional systems

- MacDonald, Polania, D'angiolillo, and Fernandez (in prep.) describes the code structure and demonstrates the main features

CHANGELOG
- 09/22/2022: updated some exoMMR structure for better flow and easier use; updated run_sim() to create SLURM job_arrays instead of individual 
jobs; updated make_sim_file() and run_sim() to allow optional/changing inputs for SLURM; updated tools.maxe() so that it would return an error 
code, not just exit() python
- 09/14/2022: exoMMR launches on github and becomes pip installable. I guess not a change, but seemed good to start the log somewhere.
